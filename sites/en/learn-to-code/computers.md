# What is a computer?

* A smart box
  * desktop
  * laptop
  * cell phone
  * smart phone

# The Universal Machine

* A computer can do anything
  * (at least on the inside)
* This can be intimidating!
* But the basic rules are simple

# The Terminal

* the *TERMINAL* is a window into which you can talk directly to your computer

# In The Beginning Was The Command Line

* the *TERMINAL* is a window into which you can talk directly to your computer
* aka *console* or *command line* or *command prompt* or *shell* or *prompt*
  * contrast *CLI* (Command Line Interface) to *GUI* (Graphical User Interface)

* ["In The Beginning Was The Command Line"](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html) is an essay by Neil Stephenson describing the history of computers in an enjoyable and clever way

# The Scala REPL - (Read, Eval, Print, Loop)

* What is a REPL? [Read more here...]()

## Exercise: Calculator

* open a terminal
* type `scala`
* press the `return` key (also called `enter`)
* see the `scala>` prompt
* type `1 + 1`
* press the `return` key again
* see `res0: Int = 2`
  * The result is after the equals sign
* yay, you built a calculator!

* Bonus: what other math can you do?

* From now on, whenever you see text in the `code font`, try typing it into the scala REPL and see what happens!

# Computer Anatomy: Hardware

Things we talk about when we talk about computer hardware:
* CPU ("the brain")
* Memory
* Input/Output
  * keyboard, mouse, touch screen, monitor

# Computer Anatomy: Software

Things we talk about when we talk about computer software:
* Operating System
* Libraries
* Applications
* Languages

Every piece of software on your computer is a PROGRAM.

# A Program Is Like A Recipe

* a recipe is a collection of *ingredients* and *instructions*

![Grandma's Cookie Recipe](img/cookie-recipe.gif)

* a program is a collection of *data* and *code*

When you are writing code, you are not baking cookies, you are writing a recipe for how to make cookies.

# Languages

* every program is written in a LANGUAGE
  * some examples of programming languages include: Scala, Java, Ruby, Javascript
  * even HTML and CSS and SQL are languages
  * every computer language has a silly name
* different languages are useful in different areas, but there is a lot of overlap
* today we will learn the Scala programming language

# Scala

* Scala was invented in the early 2000s by a very nice German man named Martin Odersky.
* Martin Odersky works at a Swiss University called [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch), where a lot of work on the Scala language is done.

> "Scala is an acronym for 'Scalable Language'. This means that Scala grows with you." - [Martin Odersky](http://www.scala-lang.org/what-is-scala.html)

# Why Learn Scala?

- Writing software is:
  - **Creative**: Software is designed, and design is a way to express yourself. You can be creative within
    the confines of what is practical. Like the Golden Gate 
    Bridge was designed to be beautiful, but serve a practical purpose.

  - **Social**: Software is built by teams working together, so you have comraderie and can make
    friends. But on the other hand you must deal with personalities and prejudice.

- Writing Scala is:
  - **Fun**: Scala is enjoyable to use. It is concise way to express ideas. You can get quick feedback in
  the "REPL". You can build something then see it work (or not), which
  is satisfying.

  - **Rewarding**: Although Scala is easy to get into, it is also deep and offers opportunities for continuous
  intellectual exploration, growth, and learning. 

  - **Empowering**: A lot of opportunity exists today to get a job as a Scala programmer, and the
  the market for Scala programmers seems to be growing strongly.

- ScalaBridge is:
  - **A safe space to learn**: Trying to get into the world of tech can be intimidating. We want ScalaBridge to be a safe space
  in which newcomers can explore and learn.

# Errors Are Awesome

* Don't be afraid of errors
* Your computer is trying to help you fix your program
  * It's just *really* bad at communicating
* It's not all gibberish
* Try to read it -- really try! -- and pull out the pearls from the pig slop
