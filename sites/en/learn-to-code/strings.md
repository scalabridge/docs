# String Methods

A string understands lots of methods. Here are a few:

    "banana".toUpperCase
    "Cherry".toLowerCase
    "titanic".capitalize
    "elderberry".reverse
    "fig".length
    "".isEmpty
    "syzygy".length

Try all of these out in the Scala REPL!

# More methods

Methods on a string can be called with a `.`,
but also supports several other "operators":

    "blue" + "berry"
    "yum" * 10
    "elderberry"(8)

`+` `*` are pronounced PLUS, TIMES

Try these out in the Scala REPL!

# Combining methods

You can combine methods at will.

    "fig".toUpperCase.reverse
    "grape".reverse * 10 + "!!!"

Definitely try these out in the Scala REPL! It's pretty fun.

# LAB: Playing With Strings

* What is the reverse of "stressed"?
* How many characters long is your name?
* What does your name look like, repeated 1000 times?
* What is the tenth character of "Scala is fun"?
